Self-Updating Mod Manager for Kerbal Space Program
 
### Development Status
Pre-Alpha (not quite ready for people to try out yet)

### Description
Tinker Time is a Mod Manager for Kerbal Space Program that will allow you to automatically update, enable, and disable all of your Curse.com mods.  All you have to do is enter the URL to the Curse.com mod webpage, and TinkerTime will do the rest of the work for you.

At this time, only mods hosted on Curse.com are supported.  Curse.com is the official mod repository chosen by Squad, and thus, it is the priority to establish support for.

### Requirements
- Java 7 or better
- An Active Internet Connection for Mod Downloads and Updates

## Installation
Simply download the JAR file and place it somewhere easily accessible
Double-click the JAR file to run the application

2. Using the Menu Bar, Mod > Add Mod
3. Paste the URL into the dialog, and click "OK"
4. A progress bar will appear as the mod data and zip file is downloaded
5. After the mod is copied to your mods directory, the mod will appear in the Mods List
