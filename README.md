==========

Self-Updating Mod Manager for Kerbal Space Program
 
### Development Status
Pre-Alpha (not quite ready for people to try out yet)

### Description
Tinker Time is a Mod Manager for Kerbal Space Program that will allow you to automatically update, enable, and disable all of your Curse.com mods.  All you have to do is enter the URL to the Curse.com mod webpage, and TinkerTime will do the rest of the work for you.

At this time, only mods hosted on Curse.com are supported.  Curse.com is the official mod repository chosen by Squad, and thus, it is the priority to establish support for.
